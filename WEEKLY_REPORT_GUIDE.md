## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Report looks broken in email**
**Solution**: Some email clients don't support full HTML
- Try Method 1 (attach HTML file instead)
- Or take screenshots of key sections
- Gmail and Outlook work best

### **Department report shows "No issues"**
**Solution**: That's actually good!
- Means no critical items for that team this week
- Include message: "Great job! No major issues this week"
- Focus on other departments

### **Week-over-week shows 0% change**
**Solution**: Need at least 2 weeks of data
- First week will show 0%
- Wait until next week for comparisons

### **Revenue impact shows "Unknown"**
**Solution**: MRR/TPV data may be missing
- Check Google Sheets for missing values
- Update account financial data
- Re-generate report

---

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

### **DO:**
✅ Send reports consistently (same day/time weekly)
✅ Reference action items from previous week
✅ Celebrate progress ("Issue X resolved!")

✅ Archive reports for trend analysis
✅ Customize email message with your insights
✅ Forward department reports to specific teams

### **DON'T:**
❌ Send without reading first
