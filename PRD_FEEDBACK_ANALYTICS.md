## 4. Problem Statement

### 4.1 Current State

**Challenge:** Ontop receives 100+ customer feedback items per week through Salesforce, but:

1. **Analysis is Manual & Time-Consuming**
   - CS managers spend 5-10 hours/week reading and categorizing feedback
   - Patterns emerge too slowly to be actionable
   - By the time insights surface, opportunities are missed

2. **Feedback is Siloed**
   - Salesforce data not easily accessible to product team
   - No unified view across accounts and time periods
   - Hard to connect feedback to business metrics (MRR, TPV)

3. **Prioritization is Subjective**
   - Loudest voices get attention, not necessarily most important
   - No systematic way to weight feedback by revenue impact
   - Difficult to separate noise from signal

4. **Insights Lack Evidence**
   - Anecdotal reports like "customers want X"
   - No quantification of how many customers want X
   - Hard to validate product decisions with data

### 4.2 Opportunity

**What if we could:**
- Analyze all feedback automatically in real-time
- Surface patterns and priorities using AI
- Connect feedback directly to revenue metrics
- Enable every team to access customer intelligence instantly
- Reduce analysis time from hours to minutes

### 4.3 Desired State

A world where:
- ✅ AI reads every feedback item and identifies patterns
- ✅ Priority features surface automatically with evidence
- ✅ CS team knows which accounts need attention today
- ✅ Product team validates roadmap with real customer data
- ✅ Leadership sees customer health at a glance
- ✅ Decisions are backed by comprehensive feedback analysis

   - White space for breathing room

3. **Data Visualization First**
   - Charts and graphs for quick understanding
   - Numbers with context (trends, comparisons)
   - Visual hierarchy guides attention

4. **Actionable UI**
   - Every insight has a next action
   - One-click to drill down
   - Keyboard shortcuts for power users

### 9.5 Database Schema

#### Table: `saved_reports`

```sql
CREATE TABLE saved_reports (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  report_html TEXT NOT NULL,           -- Full HTML of report
  report_data JSONB NOT NULL,          -- Structured data from AI
  filters_applied JSONB,               -- Filters used when generating
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_by VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT 'system'
);

CREATE INDEX idx_saved_reports_created_at ON saved_reports(created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_saved_reports_title ON saved_reports(title);
```

**Sample Row:**
```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "title": "Weekly Summary - Oct 7-14",
  "description": "AI-generated insights for week of October 7-14, 2025",
  "report_html": "<html>...</html>",
  "report_data": {
    "summary": "This week...",
    "topRecurringRequests": [...],
    ...
  },
  "filters_applied": {
    "dateRange": { "start": "2025-10-07", "end": "2025-10-14" },
    "segmentType": null
  },
  "created_at": "2025-10-14T09:00:00Z",
  "created_by": "automated_weekly"
}
```

---

### 9.6 Security Architecture

#### Authentication
- **Method:** Password-based (simplified for internal use)
- **Password:** Hardcoded (`Ontop#2025`) in `pages/login.vue`
- **Session:** Stored in `localStorage` (client) and cookie (server)
- **Middleware:** Global auth guard on all routes except `/login`

**Future Enhancement:** Replace with Auth0/Clerk/Supabase Auth

#### API Security
- **Google Sheets:** Service account with read-only access
- **Gemini AI:** API key stored in environment variables
- **Supabase:** RLS policies enabled (allow all for now)

#### Data Privacy
- **PII Handling:** Customer feedback may contain PII
- **Storage:** Data stored in Supabase (encrypted at rest)
- **Transit:** HTTPS enforced on all requests
- **Access Control:** Internal team only (no external access)

**Compliance Considerations:**
- GDPR: Customer data from Salesforce (Ontop's responsibility)
- Data retention: No automatic deletion (manual process)
- Right to be forgotten: Manual data removal required

---

### 9.7 Performance Considerations

#### Frontend Performance
- **SSR:** Initial page load < 2 seconds
- **Code Splitting:** Automatic per-page bundles
- **Image Optimization:** Lazy loading for avatars/logos
- **Bundle Size:** < 500KB initial JS bundle

#### API Performance
- **Google Sheets:** < 3 seconds to fetch 1500 rows
- **AI Generation:** < 60 seconds for full report
- **Caching:** No caching currently (always fresh data)

**Future Optimizations:**
- Cache Google Sheets data for 5 minutes
- Implement incremental data fetching
- Pre-generate reports overnight for faster access

#### Database Performance
- **Supabase:** Indexed queries < 100ms
- **Report Storage:** Compressed HTML to reduce size
- **Query Optimization:** Use JSONB indexes for filters

---

## 10. Data Model & Structure

### 10.1 Core Data Types

#### FeedbackItem

```typescript
interface FeedbackItem {
  id: string                          // Unique identifier
  accountOwner: string                // Account manager name
  platformClientId: string            // Client ID in platform
  accountName: string                 // Company name
  realMrrLastMonth?: number           // Monthly recurring revenue
  lastInvoicedTpv?: number            // Total payment volume
  csInsightName?: string              // CS insight category
  createdDate: Date                   // Feedback creation date
  subcategory?: string                // Feedback subcategory
  feedback: string                    // Raw feedback text (FULL TEXT)
  feedbackDirectedTo?: string         // Team: Product, Support, etc.
  customerSatisfaction?: string       // CSAT score
  categoryFormulaText?: string        // Auto-assigned category
  sentiment?: 'Positive' | 'Neutral' | 'Negative'  // Sentiment classification
  sentimentScore?: number             // Score 0-10
  topics?: string[]                   // Extracted topics
}
```

**Data Source:** Google Sheets (mapped from Salesforce export)

**Transformations:**
- `createdDate`: Parsed from string to Date object
- `realMrrLastMonth`: Parsed to number, defaults to 0
- `feedback`: Trimmed, but NOT truncated (full text preserved)
- `sentiment`: Calculated client-side if missing

---

### 10.2 Google Sheets Mapping

**Sheet Structure:**
| Column | Type | Maps To |
|--------|------|---------|
| A | Text | id (Platform ID) |
| B | Text | accountOwner |
| C | Text | platformClientId |
| D | Text | accountName |
| E | Number | realMrrLastMonth |
| F | Number | lastInvoicedTpv |
| G | Text | csInsightName |
| H | Date | createdDate |
| I | Text | subcategory |
| J | Text | feedback |
| K | Text | feedbackDirectedTo |
| L | Text | customerSatisfaction |
| M | Text | categoryFormulaText |

**Parsing Logic:**
```typescript
// server/api/sheets/data.get.ts
const rows = await sheets.spreadsheets.values.get({
  spreadsheetId: config.googleSheetsId,
  range: 'A2:M' // Skip header row
})

const data = rows.data.values.map(row => ({
  id: row[0] || '',
  accountOwner: row[1] || '',
  platformClientId: row[2] || '',
  accountName: row[3] || '',
  realMrrLastMonth: parseFloat(row[4]) || 0,
  lastInvoicedTpv: parseFloat(row[5]) || 0,
  csInsightName: row[6] || '',
  createdDate: new Date(row[7]),
  subcategory: row[8] || '',
  feedback: row[9] || '', // FULL TEXT, not truncated
  feedbackDirectedTo: row[10] || '',
  customerSatisfaction: row[11] || '',
  categoryFormulaText: row[12] || ''
}))
```

---

### 10.3 AI Payload Structure

**What AI Receives (RAW TEXT ONLY):**

```typescript
// Sent to Gemini API
{
  feedbackItems: [
    {
      accountName: "Acme Corp",
      accountOwner: "Sarah Martinez",
      realMRR: 5000,
      lastTPV: 50000,
      createdDate: "2025-10-10",
      feedbackText: "We really need better API documentation. The current docs are outdated and missing examples. This is blocking our integration project.",
      feedbackDirectedTo: "Product",
      // NO SENTIMENT
      // NO CATEGORY
      // NO SUBCATEGORY
    },
    // ... more items
  ],
  context: {
    totalFeedback: 1554,
    dateRange: { start: "2025-10-01", end: "2025-10-14" },
    segment: "All Customers"
  }
}
```

**Why No Pre-Labels:**
- Avoids confirmation bias
- AI discovers patterns naturally from text
- More specific insights (not constrained by categories)
- AI can infer sentiment from language, not labels

---

### 10.4 Report Data Structure

#### AIRecommendationsResponse

```typescript
interface AIRecommendationsResponse {
  summary: string                     // Executive summary
  topRecurringRequests: RecurringRequest[]
  quickWins: string[]
  emergingPatterns: string[]
  criticalRisks: CriticalRisk[]
  metadata: {
    generatedAt: string
    itemsAnalyzed: number
    dateRange?: { start: string, end: string }
  }

- **Password:** `Ontop#2025`
- **Session:** Stored in localStorage and httpOnly cookie
- **Protection:** Global middleware on all routes

**Limitations:**
- Single shared password (no user accounts)
- No role-based access control
- Password in source code (not ideal)

**Planned Improvements:**
- Implement Auth0/Clerk/Supabase Auth
- User accounts with email/password
- Role-based access: Admin, Manager, Viewer
- SSO for enterprise (Google Workspace)

### 12.2 Data Security

**Data in Transit:**
- ✅ HTTPS enforced (Vercel automatic)
- ✅ API calls use encrypted connections
- ✅ No sensitive data in URL params

**Data at Rest:**
- ✅ Supabase: Encrypted at rest (AES-256)
- ✅ Google Sheets: Encrypted by Google
- ⚠️ Environment variables: Stored in Vercel (encrypted)

**Data Access:**
- ✅ Google Sheets: Read-only service account
- ✅ Supabase: RLS policies (currently allow-all)
- ⚠️ No audit logs of who accessed what

**Planned Improvements:**
- Implement Supabase RLS policies per user
- Add audit log for data access
- Encrypt sensitive fields in database

### 12.3 API Security

**Current Protection:**
- Server-side API routes (not exposed publicly)
- No CORS (same-origin only)
- Rate limiting: Vercel's default (100 req/sec)

**Vulnerabilities:**
- No API key authentication
- No request signature validation
- No IP whitelisting

**Planned Improvements:**
- Add API key for external access
- Implement rate limiting per user
- Add request throttling for AI endpoint

### 12.4 Compliance Considerations

#### GDPR (EU)
- **Applicability:** Customer feedback may include EU citizen data
- **Requirements:**
  - Right to access: Can export data ✅

- **Recommendation:** Retain feedback for 2 years, then archive
- **Implementation:** Scheduled job to archive old data

### 12.5 Security Best Practices

**Code Security:**
- ✅ No secrets in source code (use env vars)
- ✅ Dependencies updated regularly
- ⚠️ No security scanning (Dependabot recommended)

**Infrastructure Security:**
- ✅ Vercel handles DDoS protection
- ✅ Automatic SSL certificates
- ✅ CDN with WAF protection

**Incident Response:**
