Eso pasó en todo el reporte de enero y parte del de diciembre. De momento, creo que ya el equipo pudo resolverlo pero para que lo tengan en cuenta para otras ocasiones
Y bueno, no me gusta ponerlos a trabajar extra con esto, entonces si pudieran arreglar la función que permite descargar el archivo desde la plataforma con el # de invoice, estaría genial
Para referencia, cuando voy a ""Invoices"", y a la derecha de cada pago selecciono la opción de ""Download Summary"", me sale la opción de descargar el resumen en Excel o PDF. Nosotros necesitamos el Excel porque es lo que nos permite hacer el cruce de la data con la nuestra para poder hacer las conciliaciones, sin embargo, allí no sale el # de invoice (y por eso es que me toca pedírtelo todos los meses)
La versión PDF si incluye esta información así que imaginaría es un error técnico que pudiera solucionarse fácilmente (no lo sé), pero el PDF no nos permite cruzar la info con la nuestra, y esta desorganizado entonces toma mucho más tiempo buscar cada pago manualmente
Te dejo todo por si esto les ayuda a entender el issue y si es posible hacer el ajuste para poder descargar nuestros invoices directo desde la plataforma"

One real example was the one of a contractor who has to pay monthly their child's day care in colombia, he knows it is an amount of X cop but he cannot know exactly how much it is in USD BEFORE he starts the transfer flow, he mentioned he wanted to be able to calculate how much would that x amount of COP be in USD before initiating a transfer."

At the outset, Gary, our pre-sales specialist, played a crucial role in helping us understand the tool?s capabilities in depth. He took the time to set up multiple sessions with our internal stakeholders, patiently walking us through the platform and addressing all our questions. His thoroughness and clarity were instrumental in building early confidence and alignment across our teams.

During the implementation phase, Dayana?s support was equally exceptional. She was prompt, detail-oriented, and highly effective in her communication. From day one, she took complete ownership of the onboarding process, ensuring that all action items were closed efficiently and any issues were quickly resolved. Although we encountered some expected teething issues during rollout, Dayana was always available and incredibly supportive, which gave us great comfort and made the transition feel seamless.

Together, Gary and Dayana made what could have been a complex deployment feel well-coordinated and hassle-free. We truly appreciate their dedication and partnership, and we look forward to continuing this collaboration."

En cuanto a oportunidades de mejora, algo que me gustaría sugerir es que evalúen la posibilidad de permitir el pago de tarjetas de crédito americanas directamente desde la plataforma. Por ejemplo, en Estados Unidos, es posible pagar una tarjeta de crédito (como la de Citi Bank) desde una cuenta de ahorros en otro banco (como Bank of America) simplemente ingresando el routing number y número de cuenta, sin intermediarios. Así como el hecho de que los contratistas puedan recibir dinero en la wallet (no sólo el del pago mensual que les hago yo) ,este tipo de integraciones generaría más valor agregado, Incluso sería viable que monetizaran esta función cobrando, por ejemplo, 10 dólares por cada transferencia. Personalmente, pagaría ese valor sin dudarlo si esto me permitiera hacer el proceso de forma más directa y eficiente.
En cuanto a tu servicio, solo tengo palabras positivas y de agradecimiento. La atención desde el momento 0 ha sido excelente, clara, oportuna y siempre con excelente disposición,te doy un 10/10.

They wanted to set up ACH for their membership payment and tried with two different US bank accounts, but couldn't proceed because of an alert from their bank (Chase). For this reason, they paid the membership fee with CC (Just bc for membership there aren't additional fees with Cs).

When it was time for the compensation payment, the client again tried to use ACH with the same two Chase bank accounts and encountered the same alert. The client was advised to contact with Chase Bank, but the bank said that everything was fine on their end and that the issue was ours.

I created the Ticket 91443 to chechk if there was something on our side (bugs or something), but the response was that OnTop has not impediments preventing ACH transactions in this case. The client absolutely needed to make the payment, so they proceeded with CC (fees), which made them not pretty happy.

Although the client has technically completed the implementation steps, I've decided not to proceed with the hand-off. My intention is to keep them with us directly for another month to check potential solutions. We suggested using US wire ($15 fee), but that's not an option for them; they just want to use ACH and avoid fees."

I really appreciate Dayana´s support and willingness to help, especially with all my last-minute changes! The only thing I wanted to mention is that when we were creating the contract to ste the employee's start and end times, we were not able to set half-hours or anything in between, you fixed it reporting the right info wit the HR team, but that's the only thing I can think of right now regarding platform feedback."

They perceived it as we were going to charge them for a service they already had (an implementation specialist dedicated to new onboardings), and even though we made emphasis in other parts of the product I could tell they did not like very much the idea.
The approach we made was good, because they promise their clients onboardings in less than 48 hs, and that is not our SLA. But we have been helping them to achieve this all this time."

""Te comento lo que hablamos del tipo de cambio de Ontop:
Nosotros queremos pagar en euros, con lo que los importes que metemos en las facturas y el que vamos a pagar son en euros
La página web de Ontop cambia el importe de pagos de euros a dólares con un tipo de cambio, y genera todo el extracto en dólares. En el mes de junio se ha aplicado un tipo de cambio de 0,861609.
Para realizar el pago, generáis un link en Tazapay que vuelve a realizar el cambio de dólares a euros para pagar, pero en este caso, el tipo de cambio SIEMPRE es mayor que el aplica Ontop. En el mes de junio se aplicó un cambio de 0,87354135
La diferencia del tipo de cambio aplicada en junio es de 0,01193235, que con el importe total que salía a pagar en dólares es de 991,3337137
Es decir, nosotros metemos los importes a pagar en euros, pagamos en euros, pero al ?forzarnos? tener que cambiar las facturas a dólares hemos tenido que pagar 1000? de más por absolutamente nada de nada"""

Problems with names on invoices: They mention that one of our POCS has had difficulty differentiating between contractors because the names on the invoices are incomplete (first name and first surname), which makes identification difficult and can lead to errors. They request that full names be displayed.
Problems with the Excel template for contracts: POC reports that the Excel template for creating contracts in bulk is not working properly, especially with payment dates, forcing her to create contracts one by one.
Lack of filter to search for invoices: POC mentions that there is no search function to find invoices for a specific individual, which is a recurring difficulty."

Sin embargo, al ingresar a la app, el costo aparece como $14.90. Consultando con soporte, me comentaron que esa promoción ya no está vigente y que enviaron un comunicado informándolo. Algunas personas me han preguntado por esta diferencia, y entiendo que puede resultar confuso recibir información que luego cambia solo a través de un correo. Me parece que sería bueno encontrar la forma de alinear mejor la comunicación para evitar estas dudas y seguir generando confianza con el equipo!

Paso por aquí a compartirles un feedback recurrente que estoy teniendo de los contractors respecto del servicio de soporte de Ontop. La visión generalizada es que hay un área de oportunidad grande en la atención al cliente.
Si tuviera que resumir el feedback que recabe:
No hay buena disposición a resolver las dudas, en general las respuestas suenan un tanto guionadas y si resuelven la duda bien y si no la resuelve igual la dan por resuelta.
Inclusive hay quieres reportan que nunca recibieron respuesta.
No tienen prácticas de cordialidad.

In Ontop?s case, however, the client has to send emails to the candidates in order to redirect them to their website, and only then does the process begin. They suggested it would be very helpful if we could also upload interested candidates directly into their website to streamline the workflow. Regarding budget, they said they have already spoken with support but so far have only received very junior candidates. They want to know if, with a higher budget, we could send them more senior profiles. They also plan to hire 8 more people this year and asked to receive the health insurance proposal mentioned, noting that most of their workers are between 30 and 40 years old."

This has made them consider leaving, even though they process around 20,000 USD in payments. They urgently need support on two points: (1) reimbursements, as they are waiting for supporting documents to confirm fee overcharges and will share a list of pending items; and (2) billing, since they switched to Ontop Signs with the agreement that invoices would be issued from Colombia, but if invoices come from the U.S., they would face additional withholding costs, which was not part of the agreement. The client emphasized that if these issues are not resolved by next week, they will move forward with Deel, who is offering them better costs."

They have also experienced difficulties with Ontop Balance, as it feels inconvenient and complicated to use when the available balance is lower than the amount required.

In addition, Ontop currently does not allow contractors to withdraw more than $10,000 from the wallet, and having to fill out a typeform every time this amount is needed is not a viable solution for them, especially since one of their contractors has payments above $10,000. The client would like to request an exception for this case.

The POC mentioned that their CEO felt disappointed and was considering reviewing other providers, because we didn´t agreed to pay to their workers while the funds arrived.

They had to calculate the exact amounts manually in order to apply it. The client would like the option to pay part of an invoice directly with Ontop Balance and then have the system automatically show the remaining balance to be paid using another payment method.

They would like the invoices for their staff to include details showing what each additional payment corresponds to. Currently, they make adjustments in Excel, but when the file is uploaded, the system resets to the standard fields. With many contractors, changing each one individually is very time-consuming."

He mentioned that the credited amount did not match the receipt and suggested that the system should reflect exactly what he transfers to avoid confusion. Support had explained that the balance was credited based on what was entered, not the receipt, and he processed a new credit for the difference. Additionally, he needs to open a new entity to migrate contracts from Arkano Uruguay, while keeping both accounts active to improve organization and expand headcount across different countries.

Ana María expressed overall satisfaction with Ontop, though she mentioned a past double-payment incident that was resolved.

Key opportunities identified:

Benefits adoption: Workers need more visibility on products like Reserve, Pluria, and SafetyWing, to maximize the value of being on Ontop. Ana María welcomed clear materials and suggested periodic sessions for workers to increase adoption.

Communication: She highlighted the need for more proactive updates from Ontop about new features, compliance changes, or local requirements (e.g., tax forms in RD), to anticipate issues.

Growth: Devsu expects steady hiring through Q4, signaling expansion potential and the importance of aligning early on benefits to support retention.

We explained that due to new regulations, clients must self-manage payroll uploads starting September 30th, and agreed on a training session the week of September 22nd so Lorena?s team can run this month?s payroll directly on the platform.

Lorena confirmed internal alignment but stressed the need for legal approval (Maca) before signing. We are awaiting that confirmation to proceed with contract signature. Once approved, our priority will be to guide them step by step to ensure a smooth transition and compliance with their audit requirements.

Opportunities were highlighted around exploring additional products (Reserve, SafetyWing, Pluria) for future adoption, but the main focus remains on finalizing the contract and training for payroll execution.

Next Steps:

The same happens when terminating a contract, and they would like this process to be automated.

They also mentioned that it would be useful if contractors could be identified by their national ID number, for example in the Excel payroll reports they download.

Aside from these details, the client expressed they are very happy with the platform and emphasized that both Ezequiel and Yaritza have been very diligent in addressing their issues. They will not be growing much but they will be hiring 2 contractors this or the next month.
