## 9. Key Design Decisions

### Why Unbiased AI Analysis?
**Decision:** AI reads raw feedback text without pre-labeled categories

**Reason:**
- Pre-labels create confirmation bias
- AI discovers genuine patterns from actual customer language
- More specific insights (not constrained by categories)

**Example:**
- ❌ Old way: "10 customers mentioned 'API issues'"
- ✅ New way: "23 customers ($125K MRR) need better API docs with code examples"

---

### Why Revenue-Weighted Prioritization?
**Decision:** Rank feedback by frequency × account MRR

**Reason:**
- Not all customers have equal business impact
- Focus on high-value account needs
- Prevent over-indexing on loud but low-value requests

**Formula:**
```
Priority Score = Request Count + (Total MRR / 10,000)
```

---

## 10. Known Limitations

### Current Constraints
1. **Data Source**: Depends on manual Salesforce → Sheets export
2. **Authentication**: Simple password (no role-based access)
3. **Language**: English only
4. **AI Cost**: Gemini API charges per report

### Future Improvements
1. Direct Salesforce API integration (Q2 2026)
2. SSO with Google Workspace (Q1 2026)
3. Multi-language support (Q3 2026)
4. Optimize AI costs with caching

---

## 11. Dependencies & Risks

### Critical Dependencies
| Dependency | Risk | Mitigation |
|------------|------|------------|
| Google Sheets | Manual export can fail | Move to Salesforce API (Q2 2026) |
| Gemini AI | API changes/pricing | Abstract provider, have OpenAI fallback |
| Vercel Hosting | Platform lock-in | Low risk, easy to migrate |

### Top Risks
1. **Low Adoption**: Users don't switch from manual process
   - Mitigation: Weekly training, celebrate wins publicly
2. **Data Quality**: Incomplete/inconsistent feedback
   - Mitigation: Validation rules, CS team guidelines
3. **AI Accuracy**: Generic or incorrect insights
   - Mitigation: Manual validation, iterate prompts

---

## 12. Integration Strategy

### Current: Google Sheets
✅ **Pros:** Fast setup, no API complexity  
❌ **Cons:** Manual export, not real-time

### Planned: Salesforce Direct API
📋 **Timeline:** Q2 2026  
🎯 **Benefits:** Real-time sync, no manual work  
⚠️ **Effort:** 4-6 weeks development

### Future: Support Tickets, Chat, Calls
🔮 **Vision:** Unified voice-of-customer across all channels
